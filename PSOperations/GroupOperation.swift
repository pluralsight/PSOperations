This file shows how operations can be composed together to form new operations.

/**
    A subclass of `Operation` that executes zero or more operations as part of its
    own execution. This class of operation is very useful for abstracting several 
    smaller operations into a larger operation. As an example, the `GetEarthquakesOperation`
    is composed of both a `DownloadEarthquakesOperation` and a `ParseEarthquakesOperation`.

    Additionally, `GroupOperation`s are useful if you establish a chain of dependencies, 
    but part of the chain may "loop". For example, if you have an operation that
    requires the user to be authenticated, you may consider putting the "login" 
    operation inside a group operation. That way, the "login" operation may produce
    subsequent operations (still within the outer `GroupOperation`) that will all
    be executed before the rest of the operations in the initial chain of operations.
