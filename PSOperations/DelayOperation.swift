/** 
    `DelayOperation` is an `Operation` that will simply wait for a given time 
    interval, or until a specific `NSDate`.

    It is important to note that this operation does **not** use the `sleep()`
    function, since that is inefficient and blocks the thread on which it is called. 
    Instead, this operation uses `dispatch_after` to know when the appropriate amount 
    of time has passed.

    If the interval is negative, or the `NSDate` is in the past, then this operation
    immediately finishes.
