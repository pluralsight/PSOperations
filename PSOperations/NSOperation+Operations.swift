     would just conform to the `OperationDebuggable` protocol and implement `debugData()`, but swift
     currently doesn't allow method overrides when extensions are involved. By making `NSOperation`
     implement `debugData` this would prevent all subclasses from implementing it (`Operation` and
     `GroupOperation`). To get around this we are adding a special method just for `NSOperation` and
     the debug generation code needs to have specific handling for it.
